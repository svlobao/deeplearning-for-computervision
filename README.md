## Deep Learning for Computer Vision

### Description:

I have been studying [Justin Johnson's](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/) [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r) course, and I decided to try and implement some of its algorithms, _from scratch_!

I feel it gives one a good perspective on what's going on behind the curtains, and will surely help make crucial decisions in business or scientific contexts. So I am all in on it!

### Roadmap:

- [ x ] Nearest Neighbors (NN)
- [ ] K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
