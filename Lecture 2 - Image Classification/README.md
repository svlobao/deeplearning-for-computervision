# Lecture 2: Image Classification

### Summary

Lecture talks about:

- Limitations in computer vision
- A few notable datasets.
- Intro. to classifiers
  - Nearest Neighbor

### Notes

- Nearest Neighbor
  - Memorizes _all data_
  - Define _Distance Metric_
    - L1 or "Manhattan Distance": a sum of the differences between pixels from both images, as in (a11 - b11) + (a12 - b12) + ... (aij - bij)

### Implementations
